Create a membership

Creates a new membership in a `goal` or `project`. `Teams` or `users` can be a member of `goals` or `projects`.  Returns the full record of the newly created membership.

### Example
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using AsanaNet.Api;
using AsanaNet.Client;
using AsanaNet.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class CreateMembershipExample
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Configuration config = new Configuration();
            config.BasePath = "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0";
            // Configure Bearer token for authorization: personalAccessToken
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN";
            // Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
            config.AccessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";

            var apiInstance = new MembershipsApi(config);
            var optPretty = true;  // bool? | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. (optional) 
            var createMembershipRequest = new CreateMembershipRequest?(); // CreateMembershipRequest? | The updated fields for the membership. (optional) 

            try
            {
                // Create a membership
                CreateMembership201Response result = apiInstance.CreateMembership(optPretty, createMembershipRequest);
                Debug.WriteLine(result);
            }
            catch (ApiException  e)
            {
                Debug.Print("Exception when calling MembershipsApi.CreateMembership: " + e.Message);

                Debug.Print(e.StackTrace);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using the CreateMembershipWithHttpInfo variant
This returns an ApiResponse object which contains the response data, status code and headers.

try
{
    // Create a membership
    ApiResponse<CreateMembership201Response> response = apiInstance.CreateMembershipWithHttpInfo(optPretty, createMembershipRequest);
    Debug.Write("Status Code: " + response.StatusCode);
    Debug.Write("Response Headers: " + response.Headers);
    Debug.Write("Response Body: " + response.Data);
}
catch (ApiException e)
