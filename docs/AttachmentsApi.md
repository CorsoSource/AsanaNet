Upload an attachment

Upload an attachment.  This method uploads an attachment on an object and returns the compact record for the created attachment object. This is possible by either:  - Providing the URL of the external resource being attached, or - Downloading the file content first and then uploading it as any other attachment. Note that it is not possible to attach files from third party services such as Dropbox, Box, Vimeo & Google Drive via the API  The 100MB size limit on attachments in Asana is enforced on this endpoint.  This endpoint expects a multipart/form-data encoded request containing the full contents of the file to be uploaded.  Requests made should follow the HTTP/1.1 specification that line terminators are of the form `CRLF` or `\\r\\n` outlined [here](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01#Basic-Rules) in order for the server to reliably and properly handle the request.

# **GetAttachmentsForObject**
> GetAttachmentsForObject200Response GetAttachmentsForObject (string parent, bool? optPretty = null, int? limit = null, string? offset = null, List<string>? optFields = null)

Get attachments from an object

Returns the compact records for all attachments on the object.  There are three possible `parent` values for this request: `project`, `project_brief`, and `task`. For a project, an attachment refers to a file uploaded to the \"Key resources\" section in the project Overview. For a project brief, an attachment refers to inline files in the project brief itself. For a task, an attachment refers to a file directly associated to that task.  Note that within the Asana app, inline images in the task description do not appear in the index of image thumbnails nor as stories in the task. However, requests made to `GET /attachments` for a task will return all of the images in the task, including inline images.

            var parent = 159874;  // string | Globally unique identifier for object to fetch statuses from. Must be a GID for a `project`, `project_brief`, or `task`.
            var optPretty = true;  // bool? | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. (optional) 
            var limit = 50;  // int? | Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100. (optional)

            var optFields = new List<string>?(); // List<string>? | This endpoint returns a compact resource, which excludes some properties by default. To include those optional properties, set this query parameter to a comma-separated list of the properties you wish to include. (optional)

| **200** | Successfully retrieved the specified object&#39;s attachments. |  -  |
| **400** | This usually occurs because of a missing or malformed parameter. Check the documentation and the syntax of your request and try again. |  -  |
| **401** | A valid authentication token was not provided with the request, so the API could not associate a user with the request. |  -  |
| **403** | The authentication and request syntax was valid but the server is refusing to complete the request. This can happen if you try to read or write to objects or properties that the user does not have access to. |  -  |
| **404** | Either the request method and path supplied do not specify a known action in the API, or the object specified by the request does not exist. |  -  |
| **500** | There was a problem on Asana’s end. In the event of a server error the response body should contain an error phrase. These phrases can be used by Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server error. Some errors are due to server load, and will not supply an error phrase. |  -  |
